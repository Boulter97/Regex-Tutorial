# Tutorial Understanding a Specific Regular Expression

Introduction

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. in this tutorialm we will delve into the
functionality of a specific regular expression, breakinf down each part and explaining it's purpose. By the end of this tutorial you will have a comprehensive understanding of how the regular expression works and how to effectively interpret and utilze it.

## Summary

This tutorial is to explain the inner workings of the below regular expession:

^([A-Za-zO-9._%+-]+)@([A-Za-zO-9.-]+)\.([A-Za]{2,})$

The main objective of this regex is to validate email addresses. We will go over each component of the expression describing its role and
significance.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors set the boundaries for the regex. in this instance

- `^` is the start anchor. it marks the beginning of the text we want to match.
- `$` is the end anchor. it marks the end of the text we want to match.
  These anchors make sure we only catch the email address with and extra stuff attached to it.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers determine how many times a character or group should appear. in our regex:

`+` Means "one or more". it makes sure that the username and domain name have at least one valid character, like letters, dots, numbers,
underscores, percentage signs, plus signs or hyphens.

### OR Operator

The OR operator gives us choices to match different options, in our regex we dont have a specific OR operator, but we can consider the
use of `.` and `-` as alernatives to match different characters.

### Character Classes

Character classes define sets of allowed characters, in this regex
`[A-Za-zO-9]` allowes uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers.
`._%+-` represents specific characters like dots, underscores, percentage signs, plus signs and hyphens.
These character classes make sure we can only accept valid characters for the email adress.

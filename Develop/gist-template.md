# Tutorial Understanding a Specific Regular Expression

Introduction

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. in this tutorialm we will delve into the
functionality of a specific regular expression, breakinf down each part and explaining it's purpose. By the end of this tutorial you will have a comprehensive understanding of how the regular expression works and how to effectively interpret and utilze it.

## Summary

This tutorial is to explain the inner workings of the below regular expession:

^([A-Za-zO-9._%+-]+)@([A-Za-zO-9.-]+)\.([A-Za]{2,})$

The main objective of this regex is to validate email addresses. We will go over each component of the expression describing its role and
significance.

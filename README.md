 Regex-Tutorial
- 

**Project Description**
-
This homework is to develop an application called a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

-Developer notes:- works locally but having problems with heroku will fix in future development.
